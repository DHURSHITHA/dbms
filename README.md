# Database Lab – Complete README & Topic Guide

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains **multiple database implementations (DB1–DB7)** demonstrating **core RDBMS concepts (MySQL)** and **NoSQL concepts (MongoDB)**. Each database focuses on a **specific real-world use case** such as employee management, e-commerce, banking, library systems, triggers, stored procedures, joins, and aggregations.

The project is ideal for **DBMS lab records, exams, viva, and GitHub portfolio**.
